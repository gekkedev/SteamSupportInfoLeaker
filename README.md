# SteamSupportInfoLeaker
Adds Steam game support info to store pages. More specifically, support website and mail address of the publisher are being shown. It makes GMail sending buttons on store pages appear in order to file complaints or bug reports way faster.

## Usage
1. Go to the [Steam store](http://store.steampowered.com).
2. Click on any game of your choice. (no pack)
4. (just once) Customize the default mail subject and body with the two menu options at the right top button of Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey.
3. In the box located at the right top, you'll see the additional information. Both are clickable links.

**Note: In newer versions of Greasemonkey, the mentioned menu does not exist, but the context menu should deliver such functionality.**

## Installation
1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) (for Chrome) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (for Firefox)
2. Go [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gekkedev/SteamSupportInfoLeaker/master/SteamSupportInfoLeaker.user.js)
3. Click "Install".

## Disclaimer
Do not use this script to harrass developers/publishers by sending any kind of business inquiry.
